### Acknowledged Technical Limitations

**Formal Verification Constraints:**
1. **State Space Complexity**: TLA+ models require careful abstraction to remain computationally tractable
2. **Network Layer Abstraction**: Physical network characteristics simplified to focus on consensus logic
3. **Cryptographic Assumptions**: Perfect cryptographic primitives assumed (collision-resistant hashes, unforgeable signatures)
4. **Timing Models**: Synchrony assumptions may not capture all real-world network timing variations

**Simulation Model Limitations:**
1. **Network Topology**: Simplified connectivity model vs. complex internet routing
2. **Partition Scenarios**: Clean partition/healing model vs. gradual network degradation
3. **Implementation Details**: Protocol logic simulation vs. actual code execution
4. **Hardware Considerations**: Idealized computational resources vs. real hardware constraints
